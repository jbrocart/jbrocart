Hi, I’m currently attending a Computer Engineering bootcamp with TripleTen.
So far, I’ve learned a variety of front-end technologies including HTML, CSS, flexbox, BEM, grid layouts, transitions, media queries, DOM manipulation, JavaScript, and Figma for design.
My favorite project so far has been “Spots” because I really enjoy seeing how all the different pieces come together to create something functional and visually appealing.

A few fun facts about me: I’m half French, I currently work in the construction industry, and I’m really excited to start this new journey into tech!
